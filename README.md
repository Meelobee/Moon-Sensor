Moon-Sensor for Home-Assistant, shows 8 different moon phases

Uses the Home Assistant Moon integration - https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/moon/

Install:
 - Extract images from moon_sensor.rar to '/www/images/moon_phase/' (any folder in www works, just change the card code accordingly)
 - Enable Moon integration (See configuration.yaml)
 - Copy card code (lovelace_card.yaml) to a Lovelace Manual card (Configure UI, Manual Card.)

Looks better in a horizontal stack, or use card-mod to edit or resize.
